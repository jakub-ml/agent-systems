# Epidemic Simulation - Agent Based Systems

This project is a web-based epidemic simulation tool built with Flask, where users can configure parameters like population size, infection chance, and hospital capacity to observe the spread of disease over time. It models the behavior of individual agents (people) moving through different locations (homes, workplaces, hospitals) and updates their health status based on probabilistic rules. The system also supports saving and loading simulation scenarios for analysis and comparison.



## Overview
The page provides an interface for setting up and running a world simulation, including options to adjust parameters related to the population, disease, and simulation speed. It also displays a visual map of the simulation and dynamic charts to track its progress over time.

The **World Settings** section allows users to configure the basic environment for the simulation.
It includes sliders to adjust the initial population size, number of available hospital beds, and the income generated per hour by working agents.
These settings define the starting conditions of the simulated world, influencing how the population behaves and how resources like healthcare and money are distributed during the simulation.
